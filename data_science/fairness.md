#### Motivation

Of all of the exciting work taking place in the field of data science, the machine learning algorithm (MLA) is one of the technological advancements that has garnered the most attention — and, to many, it is the area of data science that holds the most promise for the future. However, as with all powerful technologies, MLAs also carry the risk of becoming destructive forces in the world. In the words of Paul Virilio, a French cultural theorist who has written extensively about technology: “When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution…Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress.”
