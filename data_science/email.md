#### Motivation

Teamwork in business requires many acts of communication every day, spoken and written. In an individual setting, there is one sender and one recipient of each message. In a group context, this dynamic often changes to one sender and multiple recipients for each message â€“ which can lead to complications and misunderstandings, as each recipient may interpret the same message differently. However, when group communication is effective, it can dramatically improve efficiency and productivity.
