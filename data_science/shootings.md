#### Motivation

Since 1980, there have been 101 mass shootings in the United States in which four or more victims were killed, most recently on August 31, 2019 in Odessa, TX, where 7 people died. As painful as it is, we can't turn away from these terrible numbers - what we can measure, we can change.
