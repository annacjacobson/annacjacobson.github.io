#### Motivation

Some of the most impactful decisions to our business are made early, such as business points, construction schedule, general conditions, and project staffing. These decisions are often made based on incomplete or inaccurate inputs, which many times are provided by external entities such as clients or their consultants, and may be compromised by bias, emotion, or competing agendas. While we of course bring our experience and judgement to bear when making these decisions, they can be unduly influenced by incorrect information.

Using business intellidence to inform this decision-making process has the potential to increase our objectivity and accuracy by creating visibility into the risks. For example, we can benchmark variables such as fee, contingency, projected staff-hours, and construction duration to understand if our approach to a specific project may be overly aggressive or conservative in the context of our project history. These types of analyses can be invaluable to our overall business planning, providing a factual foundation for a more transparent, informed process.
