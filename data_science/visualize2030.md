#### Motivation

Gender equality is a fundamental human right: all people are entitled to the same freedoms and opportunities, regardless of sex. Promoting and protecting gender equality, like all human rights, is a worthy development goal in itself. 

However, because gender equality must be embodied in our core social structures to have impact, it also intersects with other development goals that rely on these structures. In particular, gender equality has a symbiotic relationship with health, education, and employment. Gains in each of these areas have the potential to dramatically improve gender equality - and gains in gender equality will necessarily result in improvements in these areas.
