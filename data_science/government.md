#### Motivation

It is no surprise that wealthy, industrialized nations consistently perform well on indicators of government-influenced social progress. It is more interesting to examine how nations perform on these indicators relative to their national welath. This analysis shows which governments are making social progress depsite their economic constraints. Understanding how these countries are achieving this social value may give us insights into how their successes could translate sustainably to other nations.
