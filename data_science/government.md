#### Motivation

It is no surprise that wealthy, industrialized nations consistently perform well on indicators of government-influenced social progress. It is more interesting to examine how nations perform on these indicators relative to their national welath. This analysis shows which governments are making social progress depsite their economic constraints. Understanding how these countries are achieving this social value may give us insights into how their successes could translate sustainably to other nations.

This analysis uses a conceptual measure of social value in which relative performance on a selection of six social progress indicators is adjusted for national welath (as measured by gross domestic product per capita). This social value index is a way to identify countries where social well-being is disproportionate to economic prosperity, compared to other nations.
