---

### Project Description
Since its original construction in 1972, the Getty Villa has served as home to an impressive collection of art and antiquities. In this major renovation and expansion, the J. Paul Getty Trust increased visitor facilities and renovated its museum devoted to antiquities to serve as a center for the study of ancient art, archeology and conservation. The existing Villa, Ranch House, and conservation laboratory buildings were renovated, while nine structures were built: a cafe, auditorium, an entry court, a central plant, two parking structures, a two-story research facility, a two-story office building and a one-story laboratory building.

### Scope of Work 
Preconstruction and construction services for 460,000 SF campus renovation and expansion designed by Machado & Silvetti Associates, including renovation of original 1973 museum building and 1915 ranch house.
