  I am an engineer by training, project manager by experience, and data scientist by aspiration. I am passionate about the evolution of decisions, from data to information to insight to action - and I'm fascinated by the potential this process has to change the world around us.
  <br><br>
  When I'm not studying or working, I am immersed in my other great loves: photography, food, travel, and family.
